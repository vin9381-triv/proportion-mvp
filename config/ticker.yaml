# ============================================================
# NOTES FOR FUTURE PHASES
# ============================================================

# Phase 2 (Future): Add these categories when ready
# - geopolitical_risk: Safe-haven demand triggers
# - silver_industrial: Solar, EV, electronics demand
# - mining_supply: Production disruptions, costs
# - market_sentiment: ETF flows, positioning

# Key Principles for Query Design:
# 1. Always include metal name (gold/silver) in query
# 2. Use "prices" or "data" to focus on price-relevant articles
# 3. Avoid overly technical terms (TIPS → real rates)
# 4. Avoid seasonal terms too early (Diwali, Chinese New Year)
# 5. Keep queries 2-4 words for best API results

# Expected API Usage with Broadcast Strategy:
# - 8 companies × 1 query = 8 requests per source
# - 7 gold/silver entities × 4 queries avg = 28 requests per source
# - Total: 36 requests per source × 2 sources = 72 requests/day
# - Well within limits: GNews (100/day) + NewsData (200/day)
